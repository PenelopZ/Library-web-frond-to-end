<head><h1> Library-web-frond-to-end</h1></head>
<p>This is a small project to implement some functions. </p>
<p>These functions include creating new users, logging in to library databade, checking wrong log in information.</p>
<p>This project is a course homework, therefore, some styles are not very perfect. </p>
<p>The function part, I am using JSON and JSP</p>
<p>After I learn more HTML and CSS, I creat some newer webpages.With the follow-up study, I'll continue improving this project.</p>
